# Planning Capability Library 🎯

This is a **pointer skill**. The 6 specialized Planning skills are stored in a hidden vault to keep your startup context minimal.

## Available skills in this category

- **blueprint** — Turn a one-line objective into a step-by-step construction plan any coding agent can execute cold. Each step has a self-contained context brief — a fresh agent in a new session can pick up any step without reading prior steps.
- **concise-planning** — Use when a user asks for a plan for a coding task, to generate a clear, actionable, and atomic checklist.
- **plan-writing** — Structured task planning with clear breakdowns, dependencies, and verification criteria. Use when implementing features, refactoring, or any multi-step work.
- **planning-with-files** — Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."
- **track-management** — Use this skill when creating, managing, or working with Conductor tracks - the logical work units for features, bugs, and refactors. Applies to spec.md, plan.md, and track lifecycle operations.
- **writing-plans** — Use when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code
